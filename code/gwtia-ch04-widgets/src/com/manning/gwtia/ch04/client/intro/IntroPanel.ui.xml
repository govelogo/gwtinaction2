			<h1 style="font-face:Arial;">Introduction</h1>
			<p>Dear reader,</p>
			<p>Chapter 4 introduces widgets (and panels).</p>
			<p>The examples in this application are the three that are discussed in the chapter, namely:</p>
			<p>
				<b>Create Example</b>
				- A new widget is created from the DOM, in this case a Canvas widget, and we see how to use it as
				  well as how to get it to handle events.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Extend Example</b>
				- We see how to extend an existing widget and overide functionality on it to create a new widget.  In 
				this case, the InlineLabel widget is extended so that it reports its size when added to the DOM and to stop
				ClickHandlers being added to it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Composite Example</b>
				- We create a composite widget made up of a question label and answer text box both added to a FlowPanel.  The code
				shows how functionalities, such as getText, are delegated to components of the composite widget, but that the composite
				itself acts as a brand new widget.
