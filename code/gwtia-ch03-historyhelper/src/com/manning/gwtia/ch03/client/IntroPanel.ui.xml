			<h1 style="font-face:Arial;">Introduction</h1>
			<p>Dear reader,</p>
			<p>Chapter 3 discusses layout panels and history management as part of the overall
			application.  It mentions two helper applications that give simple examples of these
			in action.</p>
			<p>This is those two examples, and we hope that you learn as much from them application as you
				do
				from each of the examples.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Layout Example</b>
				- This shows a layout panel in action.  You can click the animate button to see layout constraints animate.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>SplitPanelLayout Example</b>
				- This shows a split layout panel in action.  You can move the sliders around to resize the panels, and click the animate button to see layout constraints animate back to original sizes.
				In addition, the west panel has a minimum size constraint.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>History Example</b>
				- This shows the history management in action.
